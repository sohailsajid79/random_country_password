# Random Country Password Generator

## The purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript syntax by building a message generator program. Every time the user runs the program, they should get a new, randomised password as the output. To make the program truly random, the password that it outputs is made up of 5 different pieces of data. 

The Features Include:

1. Lowercase Alphabet
2. Uppercase Alphabet
3. Special Characters
4. Numbers 0-9
5. Countries A-Z (no country starting with 'W')
